### Nightwing Music ###

- This project is intended to provide a way for Apple Spotify users to analyze their music taste and compare it with their friends. 

- At its core, the project works in 3 simple steps:
    - Aggregate Spotify links sent in iMessage.
    - Aggregate track features using the Spotify API
    - Perform Principal Component Analysis to show similarity between tracks classified by sender

- This project is under development, and needs some fleshing out and separation of the pieces used here, coming soon.
